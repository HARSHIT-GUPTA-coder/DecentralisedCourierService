## Decentralised Courier Service in Solidity

There have been many cases of stolen or misplaced goods in courier services. A blockchain system for courier services enables the sender and the receiver to keep track of the package. It makes sure there is no mishandling or exchange of items taking place. Unless the receiver adds a received status, it is in records that item has not been delivered.
The idea behind the blockchain application is to make sure the payment has been processed(delivery charges), the package is getting delivered to the correct address and to see if the couriers have exchanged the goods or not (possible case of malpractice) and to let all parties see the current status of the package.
